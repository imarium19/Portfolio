# 🧠 Reinforcement Learning Bias Simulation

This project models how cognitive biases such as **loss aversion** and **optimism** influence reinforcement learning.

### 🎯 Objective
Compare a normal Q-learning agent with biased agents in a simple environment with risky vs. safe choices.

### 🧩 Concepts
- **Q-learning** algorithm
- **Loss Aversion Bias:** overweighting negative rewards
- **Optimism Bias:** overweighting positive rewards
- Behavioral comparison via learning curves

### 📈 Results
- Normal agent converges to safe choice
- Loss-averse agent avoids exploration and underperforms
- Optimistic agent overexplores early but achieves higher average reward later

### 🛠️ Tools
Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
