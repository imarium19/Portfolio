# Project 3: MNIST Digit Classification

This project demonstrates a deep learning model built using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the MNIST dataset.

### 📘 Overview
- Dataset: MNIST (70,000 grayscale digit images)
- Model: Feedforward Neural Network (3 dense layers)
- Accuracy: ~98% on test data

### ⚙️ Technologies Used
- TensorFlow 2.13.0  
- NumPy 1.24.3  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

### 📊 Features
- Data normalization and visualization  
- Model training with accuracy tracking  
- Confusion matrix and sample predictions  
- Model saved as `mnist_model.h5` for reuse  

### 🧠 Key Learning
This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Neural network architecture
- TensorFlow’s Sequential API
- Model evaluation and visualization techniques
